There is no specified source of funds, and the account does not require enhanced due diligence.\n- Transaction Pattern: The customer executed 5 transactions exceeding $5,000 within 48 hours, totaling $42,800, following a large inbound credit of $48,000 received just 2 hours prior to the first outbound transaction.\n- Adverse Media: No adverse media mentions were found for Rohitash, indicating no negative news or issues associated with the customer.\n- Sanctions Check: The customer does not appear on any sanctions watchlist, confirming no compliance issues related to sanctions. \n\nOverall, while the transaction activity raises concerns due to the velocity spike and layering pattern, the customer's low-risk profile and absence of adverse media or sanctions issues provide some context for legitimacy. Further investigation into the source of funds may be warranted.\n\n**Status:** \u2705 Context gathered, checkpoint saved"
